# FWD-Professional-Data-Analysis-1st-Project

## Bike Share Data
### Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent ### bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to ### the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

## Statistics Computed
### You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, you'll write ### code to provide the following information:

### 1- Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

#### most common month
#### most common day of week
#### most common hour of day

### 2- Popular stations and trip

#### most common start station
#### most common end station
#### most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

### 3- Trip duration

#### total travel time
#### average travel time

### 4- User info

#### counts of each user type
#### counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
#### earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
